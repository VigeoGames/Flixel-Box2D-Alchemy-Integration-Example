# Flixel / Box2D (Alchemy) integration example #

## Description ##

An example integration of Flixel (http://github.com/AdamAtomic/flixel) and an
Alchemy port of Box2D library from WCK (http://github.com/jesses/wck).

## Compilation ##

To compile this example you will need:

*   Flex 4 SDK (with playerglobal.swc from this SDK)
*   Flash Player 10.1
*   Flixel library (I've used revision from 2009-12-28)
*   WCK library (I've used revision from 2009-12-30)

## Usage ##

You can use the following buttons:

*   B - spawn unconscious ragdoll
*   L - spawn non-rotating ragdoll with weapon (WIP)
*   F - toggle black outline (testing FX) ;-)

You can also drag ragdolls around with mouse.
